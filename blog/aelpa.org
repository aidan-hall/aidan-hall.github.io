I created
[[https://aidanhall.gitlab.io/aelpa][an Emacs Lisp package archive]],
just like Elpa or Melpa, because I felt like it! At the moment, it only
has two files I considered worth uploading, but it's there!

I put way too much effort into getting the logo to look just right, but
it uses Noto Sans, so it might not even look right on some browsers or
operating systems. A screenshot of what is supposed to look like is
shown below:
