#+title: AoC in C++ Algorithms: Day 3 (=regex= and =search=)
#+date: [2024-12-05 20:20]

For part 1, I just did the obvious regex-based solution. There's not
much to say about day 3 except how ludicrously slow regex code is to
compile in C++. I've heard other complaints about =std::regex=,
including claims of poor performance and issues with ABI stability, so I
would probably investigate alternative regex libraries if I ever wanted
to use regular expressions in a larger application.

My solution for part 2 was similarly straightforward. The one notable
difference from my strategy for part 1 was to do a plain-text search
(with =std::ranges::search=) for the next =do()= after encountering a
=don't()=. This optimisation took an unreasonable amount of effort
relative to the performance improvement it provided, so I wouldn't have
bothered if I hadn't seen someone else do a ridiculously fast solution
with a hard-coded finite state machine.
