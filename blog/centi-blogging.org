#+title: Centi-Blogging
#+date: [2022-05-16 12:44]

I might try posting some lower-effort stuff on here, just for a bit of
fun.

There is a concept known as
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging][Microblogging]], but I
find the association with Twitter off-putting. Instead, I shall engage
in the practice of /centi-blogging/, which I will define as writing
short blog posts that exceed the length limit for a Twitter post (280
characters).

The SI prefix /centi/ is two up from /micro/ (with /milli/ in-between).
I already chose the name before checking that and I think milli-blogging
sounds even more stupid than /centi-blogging/.

I probably won't ever use the term again, since its sole purpose is to
explain how I will be using this blog from now on.
