Yes, in just over a year. Laugh it up. Frankly I don't see quite why I
persisted, even as the symptoms kept getting worse. My hot fix is 'just
use Vim', and... yeah that's probably going to work isn't it?

Something I'd slightly forgotten is the /immediacy/ with which Vim
responds to input. This includes the NeoVim LSP client, which can do
go-to-definition and finding references with no perceptible delay
whatsoever.

I can also safely shield myself from the sunk cost fallacy by
remembering that my sunk cost for Vim is even greater!
