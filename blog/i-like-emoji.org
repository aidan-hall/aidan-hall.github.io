I like Emoji. 🤯

I think it's a fairly cool technology with an interesting history. I
love the weird and historical ones like 🕴. I find it funny that there
are distinct gender-neutral and gendered versions of professions,
suggesting that by default people have no gender:

- 👷: Construction Worker.
- 👷‍♀️: Female Construction Worker.
- 👷‍♂️: Male Construction Worker.

The thing that I really love is that these variations are constructed by
putting certain emoji characters next to each other, separated by
special joiners.

Once you understand how to combine things, you can produce all the emoji
your heart desires:

- 👩🏿‍🦲
- 👨🏾‍🚀
- 🧑‍🎓

It seems the basic MAN (👨), WOMAN (👩) and ADULT (🧑) emoji are all
amenable to composition, although CHILD (🧒) isn't. As a result, my
opinion of the technology is significantly lessened, since we can't
create a ‘child astronaut with curly ginger hair' emoji.
