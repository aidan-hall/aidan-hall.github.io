#+title: Minecraft with the Steam Controller

I recently got back into Minecraft (Java Edition, of course), but due to
my keyboard-related RSI, I decided to try using a controller to play it.

Minecraft Java doesn't have built-in controller support, so I installed
the [[https://github.com/isXander/Controlify][Controlify]] mod, which
adds this functionality, with a lot of customisation options. I started
off using my Switch Pro controller, which is supported by Controlify,
albeit without gyro input. This worked well enough, but aiming with the
right control stick felt much more restrictive than using a mouse. That
brings us to today, when I decided to try using my
[[https://store.steampowered.com/app/353370/Steam_Controller/][Steam Controller]].

The Steam Controller was part of Valve's early, failed attempt to create
a game console ecosystem (the Steam Machines). Its most distinctive
feature is the pair of circular touchpads it has in place of a typical
D-pad and right control stick. This design was made with a major
objective of allowing games that were originally designed for keyboard
and mouse controls to be played with a gamepad. This is normally
achieved through the highly flexible Steam Input configuration system
that is built into Steam, but it would have been awkward for me to use
for Minecraft, which is not a Steam game.

Instead, I used
[[https://github.com/kozec/sc-controller][SC Controller]]. This provides
a GTK-based GUI for configuring the Steam Controller that is totally
independent of Steam itself. With that, I was able to set up my Steam
Controller to interact nicely with Minecraft. The layout is heavily
inspired by
[[https://youtu.be/3aUdM3BoiIE?si=Nip0tLBuaQjw_PW8][this video]],
especially the camera controls. In that video, the Steam Controller's
inputs are all mapped to keyboard and mouse inputs, while my setup has
the small advantage of "true" analogue movement with the left stick.

I have left and right mouse bound to the right and left triggers, with
shift on the left grip button. This allows me to use all the "advanced"
inventory management inputs that work with a mouse, but were supported
poorly (or not at all) by Controlify. The other big improvement of this
layout over what I had on the Switch Pro controller is having jump bound
to the right grip button. This means I can keep my right thumb on the
camera touchpad at all times, and fluidly turn and jump at the same
time, which was not possible on the Pro controller.
