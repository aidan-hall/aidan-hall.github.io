#+title: The PaperWM GNOME Extension
#+description: The only window manager that makes Emacs' Speedbar tolerable

I've been using GNOME as my main desktop for a while now; I needed
something that "just works", with minimal configuration, so I could
focus on wasting all my time configuring Emacs instead. However, I was a
long-time tiling window manager user, so I thought I'd have a look at
the available tiling extensions for GNOME and discovered
[[https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6099/paperwm/][PaperWM]].

The idea in PaperWM is that all windows on a desktop are arranged in a
single long row, and as you switch between windows, it scrolls left and
right. This nicely complements the arbitrarily long vertical scrolling
that you see in most document-viewing applications: you usually want
these to fill the full height of the monitor, but the horizontal space
is often wasted with other window managers, especially in full-screen
text editors. I'm not honestly sure if I like this approach (it makes
the platonic ideal 60/40 split more annoying to set up than vanilla
GNOME), but it has one extremely niche benefit: it is the best window
manager possible to use with
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Speedbar.html][Speedbar]].

Speedbar is a built-in Emacs package that spawns a floating frame[fn:1]
that can show a tree view of directories, sections in a file, and useful
supplemental information for a few other contexts. This functionality
would be useful, but most are probably put off immediately by the fact
it spawns an extra floating window. This style of spawning many small
windows that provide distinct functionality is somewhat old-fashioned;
GIMP is the only other program I can recall ever functioning like this
by default on Linux. If, as is common, the user snaps their windows to
the edges of the screen, or maximises Emacs, Speedbar appears on top of
other windows, messing with their layout.

This is where PaperWM shines: Speedbar benefits from as much vertical
space as it can get, but only needs a small amount of horizontal space.
As long as your Emacs window isn't maximised, it slots into the PaperWM
layout naturally:

[[https://lists.libreplanet.org/archive/html/emacs-bug-tracker/2025-03/msg00695.html][A patch was recently merged]]
that provides an option to display Speedbar in a side window, and
there's also the long-standing
[[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/sr-speedbar.el][=sr-speedbar=]]
package, which provides similar behaviour, but in the meantime, this is
probably the least annoying way to use Speedbar.

[fn:1] The Emacs term for Operating System windows, used to avoid
       ambiguity.
