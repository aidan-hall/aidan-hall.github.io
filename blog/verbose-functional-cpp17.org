Virgin procedural programming:

#+begin_src cpp
  std::array<uint32_t, 5> high_scores;
  // ...
  std::string high_scores_string = "High Scores: ";
  for (const auto score : high_scores) {
    high_scores_string = high_scores_string + ", " + std::to_string(score);
  }
#+end_src

Chad functional programming:

#+begin_src cpp
  std::array<uint32_t, 5> high_scores;
  // ...
  auto comma_fold = [](const std::string &text, uint32_t score) {
    return text + ", " + std::to_string(score);
  };
  std::string high_scores_string =
      std::accumulate(std::next(high_scores.begin()), high_scores.end(),
                      "High Scores: " + std::to_string(high_scores.front()), comma_fold);
#+end_src

I actually just wrote these two exact pieces of code, then looked back,
and questioned my life choices.
