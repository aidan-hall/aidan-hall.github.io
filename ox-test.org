:drawers:
I can use ~org-html-format-drawer-function~ to automatically convert drawers into details/summary blocks. This mirrors their behaviour within an Org buffer, which is nice, and the syntax is much lighter-weight than the general-purpose structure templates.

There's also a function I can configure to alter the appearance of drawers within $\LaTeX$ output.

* Second Top-Level Heading!
** Coolest

* Footnotes
[fn:2] They also tend to be awkward to style in HTML, but I'll go to the effort anyway because I'm unhealthily obsessed with getting everything right.

[fn:1] They're generally quite awkward, and are only make sense in static, paged media. For web content, in the abstract, I'd prefer "side notes", written with an ~<aside>~ tag.
