  abstract =	 {Writing and its means have become detached. Unlike
                  written and drawn practices developed prior to the
                  20th century, notation for programming computers
                  developed in concert and conflict with discretizing
                  infrastructure such as the shift-key typewriter and
                  data processing pipelines. In this paper, I recall
                  the emergence of high-level notation for
                  representing computation. I show how the earliest
                  inventors of programming notations borrowed from
                  various written cultural practices, some of which
                  came into conflict with the constraints of
                  digitizing machines, most prominently the
                  typewriter. As such, I trace how practices of
                  "writing code" were fabricated along social,
                  cultural, and material lines at the time of their
                  emergence. By juxtaposing early visions with the
                  modern status quo, I question long-standing
                  terminology, dichotomies, and epistemological
                  tendencies in the field of computer
                  programming. Finally, I argue that translation work
                  is a fundamental property of the practice of writing
                  code by advancing an intercultural lens on
                  programming practice rooted in history.},

  abstract =	 {People from nearly every country are now learning
                  computer programming, yet the majority of
                  programming languages, libraries, documentation, and
                  instructional materials are in English. What
                  barriers do non-native English speakers face when
                  learning from English-based resources? What desires
                  do they have for improving instructional materials?
                  We investigate these questions by deploying a survey
                  to a programming education website and analyzing 840
                  responses spanning 86 countries and 74 native
                  languages. We found that non-native English speakers
                  faced barriers with reading instructional materials,
                  technical communication, reading and writing code,
                  and simultaneously learning English and
                  programming. They wanted instructional materials to
                  use simplified English without culturally-specific
                  slang, to use more visuals and multimedia, to use
                  more culturally-agnostic code examples, and to embed
                  inline dictionaries. Programming also motivated some
                  to learn English better and helped clarify logical
                  thinking about natural languages. Based on these
                  findings, we recommend learner-centered design
                  improvements to programming-related instructional
                  resources and tools to make them more accessible to
                  people around the world.},
