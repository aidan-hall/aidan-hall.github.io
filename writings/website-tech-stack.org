#+description: The tech stack I use for this website.

* Rationale
The website's tech stack is informed by [[id:7cdd09d4-7af0-4eeb-b19d-d77001eb864b][my design philosophy]].
My main aim is to have a stable, yet high-quality environment for writing content that I can share, and will last for decades, online.

* Technology
There are few technologies more [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect][Lindy]] than Emacs, so this blog is written and built purely with Emacs Org mode, and a small [[https://gitlab.com/aidanhall/orgsite/-/blob/main/publish-config.el][configuration script]], written in Emacs Lisp.
Org is a superior markup language, for short and medium-length articles.
I prefer my long-form writings to be self-contained, and portable, so I would continue to use LaTeX and Typst for anything of the sort.
